Manifesto for Puglia's Tech Renaissance
Building the Future of AI and SaaS Startups
In a world where innovation knows no borders, Puglia is ready to take its rightful place on the global tech map. We envision a future where this region, historically known for its cultural richness, becomes a fertile ground for AI and SaaS startups that can compete with Silicon Valley's best.

Here's our bold mission and how we plan to achieve it:

A Global Vision with Puglia at the Core
Global by Default: The world is our playground. Startups founded in Puglia will have a global mindset from day one. Whether headquartered here or using dual company structures in places like Delaware or London, we are equipped to play on the world stage.

Puglia DNA in Every Startup: The talent, creativity, and resilience of our local tech community are our unique advantages. Puglia is rich with software engineers, AI specialists, and forward-thinking innovators ready to take on global challenges. Moreover it’s a great location to attract talent from the Mediterranean region

AI and SaaS Leading the Charge: Our focus is on building AI-driven and SaaS-based companies that can scale globally. With Puglia as the base, these startups can reach customers across the globe with products and solutions designed to solve modern problems.

Mission: Create a Wave of Tech Startups at Silicon Valley Standards
Silicon Valley Ambition, Puglia Roots: We aim to create a surge of startups that meet the highest global standards of innovation, design, and execution. These companies will be lean, automated, and structured to grow fast, compete globally, and push the boundaries of AI and technology.

VC Material or Breakeven Growth: The first capital injection for any startup must focus on validating whether the business can be venture-capital worthy or self-sustaining through breakeven growth. This distinction is key to ensuring resources are effectively allocated from the outset.

Fluid and Agile: Not all startups will succeed, and that’s okay. The process will be dynamic, with failures viewed as stepping stones to success. Our approach makes room for agility, enabling founders to pivot or fail fast, clearing the way for the next big idea.

External Capital: A Fair and Open Ecosystem for Entrepreneurs
Open to External Investment: We invite like-minded investors to join us in fostering this ecosystem. Our startups will be open to external capital with fair, transparent terms, making Puglia an attractive destination for both entrepreneurs and investors.

Pre-seed Terms: The standard will be light governance constraints with a focus on trust in the founders:

$1M investment on a $10M post money valuation cap, structured via a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity).

Founder Autonomy: No board seats required; investors will only approve the founder’s salary to ensure accountability while preserving the agility startups need to innovate.

Light Governance, Big Ambition: We believe in founders first. Investors will provide the necessary capital to ignite growth while keeping oversight light. This allows startups to move quickly, iterate often, and stay focused on product development and market fit.

Automation as the Great Equalizer
Automating for Efficiency: The future of business is automated. By integrating cutting-edge AI and SaaS technologies, startups in Puglia will have the power to automate most of their back-office functions—HR, Accounting, Finance, Ops, Sales, and Marketing. This will allow them to compete with global players, all with lean teams and streamlined operations.

Competing Globally, Operating Efficiently: With automation reducing operational overheads, our startups can focus on scaling their products globally, delivering innovation faster and more efficiently than ever before.

Resilience and Fluidity: The Key to Success
Not Every Startup Will Succeed: In the startup world, not every venture will achieve its goals, but that’s a natural and essential part of the process. Each failure offers invaluable lessons, and the flexibility of our ecosystem ensures that entrepreneurs can quickly regroup and launch their next project.
A Fluid, Dynamic Ecosystem: By allowing the startup process to be fluid—without the weight of rigid corporate structures—Puglia will become a hotbed for innovation. The freedom to iterate, fail, and succeed fosters a culture where the next big idea is always around the corner.

The Future of Puglia's Tech Ecosystem
Many Startups, Many Successes: Our mission is to create a thriving ecosystem where multiple tech startups can emerge, grow, and succeed. With a focus on AI and SaaS, and an infrastructure that supports both VC-backed and self-sustaining ventures, Puglia is ready to lead Italy into the next phase of the digital revolution.
A New Paradigm for Startups: Our goal is clear: to build a tech ecosystem in Puglia where entrepreneurs are empowered, investors are inspired, and innovation is constant. This is the future of Puglia—a hub of global tech excellence.


Together, we will build a new paradigm for tech startups in Puglia, where innovation thrives, local talent shines, and global markets are within reach. 

Let’s build the future, right here, right now.
